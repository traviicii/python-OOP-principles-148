# OOP Principles

#-- Abstraction: Focusing on the "what" and not the "how"
#-- Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods within a class and controlling access to them
#-- Inhertiance: Extending a parent class, giving it additional functionality and characteristics through subclasses
#-- Polymorphism: Objects from different classes responding similarly to the same method in their own unique way
